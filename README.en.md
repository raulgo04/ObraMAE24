# Climate Change: An Educommunicative Analysis
## Overview
<br/>

This is a digital work funded by Amazon Future Engineers as part of the Meet and Code: Code for the Planet 2024 program and the European Union's Code Week through the Asociación de Jóvenes Profesionales
por el Patrimonio Cultural Cultural Heritage (AJPC). It is based on 12 educommunicative audiovisual projects aimed at media literacy on various aspects of climate change. 
These projects were created by Group A students from the "Education and Audiovisual Media" course in the third year of the Journalism Degree at Complutense University of Madrid 
during the first semester of the 2024-2025 academic year, under the coordination of Professor Raúl Gómez Hernández. 
This work draws inspiration from the futuristic vision presented in [Pig City](https://www.mvrdv.com/projects/134/pig-city) by MVRDV studio, which was showcased in the 
[Banquete 03 program by Medialab Madrid](https://archivomedialabmadrid.org/pdfjs/web/viewer.html?file=https://archivomedialabmadrid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MLM_MVRDV_esp_snp_crr.pdf).

This student-produced digital work, coordinated by faculty, consists of a structured piece designed with CSS flip cards containing AI-generated posters, infographics, and teasers about their research topics. 
In these creations, students compared past data with current information, made future predictions, and proposed possible solutions.

During the process, student groups extracted open-access data from NGOs, international institutions, or research centers such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Wildlife Fund (WWF), 
or Eurostat. They focused on topics such as arable land and consumption patterns, Earth's resources, demographic challenges, and biodiversity. They created data visualizations using open-source software
and developed AI-generated visualizations. Throughout the project, students acquired new technological skills and critical analysis abilities, learned about AI ethics, forecast generation, creativity in 
scientific communication, and participated in workshops led by artists on creativity in art and citizen laboratory practices.

2. Electric vehicles and consumption habits (car registrations, opinions, trends, etc.)  
3. Types of transportation: public (buses, metro systems, rental bicycles, etc.) vs private transportation. Habits and impact  

**Sustainability**

1. Availability of Earth's resources and population distribution (water, minerals, food production countries' relation to hunger issues)
